# **What is this modpack?**

A modpack that adds essential mods to your client. Why would you want to download these? Well, this modpack adds mods that adds changing your skin with costemics from the pause menu, messaging from your pause menu, equipping shaders- to name a few!

# **What is the purpose of this?**

Well, what if you want mods that don't add stuff like new biomes, ores, a.k.a adding new in-world features? Well, I know some people will say yes, so I made it easy for them! :D

# **What made you do this?**

Three words: I. like. modding.
(But really, I like making stuff)
